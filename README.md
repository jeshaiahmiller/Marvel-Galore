### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
<!-- *These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.* -->
- Use marvel api to receive relevant information.
- render the movies onto the page
- Allowing user to click on the movies/shows and recieve additional info about them.
- add javascript to create functionality
- style the page uding flex box and css
- add media queries to cater to different screen sizes.

#### PostMVP  
<!-- *These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.* -->
- add information for comic books and characters
- add additional styling

## Project Schedule

<!-- This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`. -->
|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|nov 7| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | complete

## Priority Matrix

<!-- Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes -->

## Timeframes
<!-- Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. -->

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
